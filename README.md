# ECE 3623 Embedded Systems Laboratory - Spring 2020

This repo contains lab reports and procedures for Temple University's ECE 3623
Embedded Systems Laboratory as taught in the sping semester of 2020.

From the main courses's syllabus:

> This Spring Junior or Senior elective ECE course with corequisite Laboratory
> considers Verilog hardware description language (HDL), C/C++ language
> programming and high level synthesis (HLS) in system-on-chip (SoC) design with
> the ARM Cortex-A9 processors and the AMBA bus interconnection of the Xilinx
> Zynq device. The operating system utilized initially is single tasking but
> then a transition to the multi-tasking, real-time operating system FreeRTOS.

Within each folder is the lab report and procedure. The code solution can be
found toward the end of each lab report.

As part of this course, we were required to make demonstration videos and
upload them to YouTube. Links to each video can be found in the corresponding
lab report. Alternatively, all of the videos are aggregated in this
[playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHGC6tiqj9YeWhFn8-0g3_L5TKjtcy5Z4)
